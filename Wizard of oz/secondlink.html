<h1>Tin Man</h1>
Movie magic! The early days of movies saw lots of DIY tricks and techniques for creating effects that would show up (and look realistic) on camera. While the Tin Man is said to cry oil in the movie, the tears you see on his silver face onscreen are actually made of chocolate syrup, which looked better on camera at the time.
